## What's in the box

Tailwind CSS - https://tailwindcss.com/docs - provides some pre-built utility styles so we don't have to define common utility styles ourselves.

Feather Icons - https://feathericons.com/ - classy, friendly icons for just about any purpose. Browse on the docs site and use them like this: `<img src="/assets/feather_icons/activity.svg">`.
